///
/// - The object (`this`) is owned by the wrapping component (e.g, a `Window`). It's released when
/// the `Window` is released.
/// - The only other place where you can retrieve a `Window` (or such control) is in the respective
/// delegate `did_load()` method, where you're passed one. This variant never includes the
/// delegate.
/// - Thus, provided the root object still exists, this pointer should be valid (root objects Box
/// them, so they ain't movin').
/// - The way this _could_ fail would be if the programmer decides to clone their `Window` or such
/// object deeper into the stack (or elsewhere in general). This is why we don't allow them to be
/// cloned, though.
