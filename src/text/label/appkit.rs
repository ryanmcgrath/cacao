//! This module does one specific thing: register a custom `NSView` class that's... brought to the
//! modern era.
//!
//! I kid, I kid.
//!
//! It just enforces that coordinates are judged from the top-left, which is what most people look
//! for in the modern era. It also implements a few helpers for things like setting a background
//! color, and enforcing layer backing by default.
