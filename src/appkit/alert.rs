//! A wrapper for `NSAlert`.
//!
//! This is housed inside `appkit` as it's a useful tool for a few cases, but it doesn't match the
//! iOS API, so we make no guarantees about it being a universal control. In general this also
//! doesn't produce an amazing user experience, and you may want to shy away from using it.
//!
//! If you want to show a complex view in an alert-esque fashion, you may consider looking at
//! `Sheet`.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use cacao::appkit::{App, AppDelegate, Alert};
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct ExampleApp;
//!
//! impl AppDelegate for ExampleApp {
//!     fn did_finish_launching(&self) {
//!
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     App::new("com.alert.example", ExampleApp::default()).run()
//! }
//! ```
