//! Wraps `NSWindow` on macOS and `UIWindow` on iOS.
//!
//! Using `WindowDelegate`, you're able to handle lifecycle events on your `Window` (such as
//! resizing, closing, and so on). Note that interaction patterns are different between macOS and
//! iOS windows, so your codebase may need to differ quite a bit here.
//!
//! Of note: on macOS, in places where things are outright deprecated, this framework will opt to
//! not bother providing access to them. If you require functionality like that, you're free to use
//! the `objc` field on a `Window` to instrument it with the Objective-C runtime on your own.
